  <p>
  An innovative expense management Web-application designed to assist users in achieving their personal financial goals. The app is equipped with advanced AI and ML algorithms, enabling it to deliver personalized responses based on each user's unique financial situation. The app allows users to manage and track their expenses effectively.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    One standout feature of the app is its ability to provide tailored responses to user queries related to their finances. For instance, users can ask questions like "do I have enough funds to buy a particular product without impacting my target goal?" The app's assistant will leverage graphs and data-driven insights to provide precise and personalized answers.
  </p>
  <p>
Furthermore, the app allows users to set a limit of spare change, which the app will set aside as savings, improving the overall financial wellness of the user. This app is a game-changer for anyone looking to save money and achieve their financial goals!
